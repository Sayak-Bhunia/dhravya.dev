I was bored, Sunday evening. I decided to make this auto-updating twitter banner using python (I've already done it.) ![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3f06zhbej393xcvw4em3.png)

But you see, I'm lazy. Really lazy. I didn't even want to make the main.py file and get straight to the coding.

> If you have to do the same thing more than 5 times, automate it.

And that's what I ended up doing. as I'm learning Rust, this could also be a nice Rust project that helps me with my everyday small projects.

Here's what create-python-program does:

- Initialises virtual environment
- Makes source directory and main.py file
- Makes README.md, .gitignore
- Initialises git repository
- Makes requirements.txt file
- Creates .env file

It's cross platform too! ![demo image](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/X8TFUouvv7QuUVaiSasWnj-ice-n8J8a31ZUTnu1RJA/http/img.dhravya.dev/r/l0fljbeby0a.png?width=1249&height=664)

## Installation and Usage

The project is available at crates.io, and you can install it easily by this command:

```
cargo install create-python-project
```

Usage:

```
create-python-project
```

And yes, that's it! Let me know what you think in the comments below! I know this project isn't THAT useful but as long as it saves one second of my time, it's worth it lol
