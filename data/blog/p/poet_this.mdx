Often times, after seeing a tweet, I go to https://poet.so to take a screenshot of it. However, this was kinda time consuming and stuff like that, but poet.so doesn't even have an API, so I create a selenium script that (very quickly) uses poet.so to take screenshots of a tweet.

To use the bot, simply reply to any tweet with @poet_this ![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k3v64asw68icnuw7qr12.png)

The project is shockingly simple, but super useful. It hardly took 20 minutes for me to make it (because I already had some experiences with the twitter API - [auto twitter banner changer](https://github.com/Dhravya/auto-twitter-banner) )

in fact, it's so simple that this is all I needed to write (with a little bit of reverse engineering of the website and some keyboard tricks)

```py
    def get_poem(self, link, savepath="tweet.png"):
        input_box = self.driver.find_element(by= "tag name", value="input")
        input_box.send_keys(link + u'\ue007')
        element = self.driver.find_element("xpath","//*[@data-export-hide]")

        # Waiting for the image to load
        time.sleep(5)
        element.screenshot(savepath)
```

Anyways, I hope you like my little project. If you have any suggestions or issues, feel free to post them on github. The repository is public here: Please ‚≠ê this! Github - https://github.com/Dhravya/poet-this

I'm considering options to host the bot too, but hosting anything using selenium is quite the pain so i'll try my best. For now it's online on my own computer
