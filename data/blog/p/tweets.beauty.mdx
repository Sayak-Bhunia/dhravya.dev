### What is Tweets.beauty

With the success of the [@Poet_this](https://twitter.com/Poet_this) project, I knew I had to start working on a much better UI for https://beautify.dhravya.dev.

So I decided to create Tweets.beauty, and bought the domain.

the idea was simple. Give users everything they have with the twitter bot, with a good UI and a simple API.

### PWA

This was my first project that I made as a progressive web app, which means it is downloadable on android, IOS and desktop.

Clicking on the 'Share' button on any tweet will show Tweets.beauty as an option, and when you click on it, it will automatically generate the image for you!

### API

Tweets.beauty also has a simple API that you can use to generate the images yourself.
