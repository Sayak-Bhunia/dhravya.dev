A couple months ago, I wrote a blog [Introducing Cakecutter](https://dhravya.dev/blog/p/cakecutter), which was, essentially, a modular version for [create-python-project](https://github.com/Dhravya/create-python-project). Both of these projects were very easy, because they were just simple projects for me to practice the Rust programming language. I made them and forgot about it. But little did I know, small projects go a long way.

But then, a couple days ago, [Yash](https://dev.to/kekdadabest) (who is a fellow admin of the [Coding Horizon community](https://discord.gg/z7MZYhmx6w) and an amazing developer), texted me, saying that he sees a lot of potential in my little pet project.

> ‚ÄúCakecutter is cool, let‚Äôs make it better‚Äù

And that‚Äôs exactly what we did.

We discussed new things we can implement, and decided to rewrite the entire thing in [Golang](https://go.dev)

## Ok, but what exactly _is_ Cakecutter?

In a nutshell, `Cakes` are templates, which contain _everything_ you need to set up a project. This includes:

- The file structure of a project (for eg. some boilerplate files, `README`, `src/` folder) [[DOCS]](https://docs.cakes.run/3-create/#file-structure)
- File content (for eg. Pre-generated licenses, or boilerplate code) [[DOCS]](https://docs.cakes.run/3-create/#file-content)
- Commands to set up a project (for eg. Downloading dependencies, creating virtual environment) [[DOCS]](https://docs.cakes.run/3-create/#running-commands)

Additionally, questions can be asked when setting up a project. Questions can be a selection between multiple things, or an input. Then, the answers to the questions can be used to fill in a template. [[DOCS]](https://docs.cakes.run/4-advance/)

An example use case for this would be, asking the name of a user to auto-generate license, or you can even generate an entire README file with it!!

You can create files based on answer to a question, for example, creating a file only if the project is a typescript project.

And, you can even run commands based on answers. Example use case would be asking host OS to run setup commands!

This is a hell lot of power and functionality in just ONE CakeFile! (Just like real cakes üòÜ)

Have a look at the [Basic example cake](https://docs.cakes.run/5-example/) and you can also try out the [Python cake](https://cakes.run/cake/python)

### Sold yet? Install cakecutter.

Head over to [https://docs.cakes.run/1-install/](https://docs.cakes.run/1-install/), or use with NPX:

```powershell
npx cc
```

## These are not even the biggest updates.

Like `create-react-app` , most people don‚Äôt like to make cakes. They like to eat them. We knew this, and a way to share cakes had to be made.

So, we created a `publish` command, so you can publish _your_ cakes for others to use!

Try out this command to instantly generate a very simple python project template. Now you don‚Äôt need to create cakes!

```
npx cc cut python
```

Also, we created the website [Cakes.run](https://cakes.run) where you can find the documentation, installation guidelines, and also browse the cakes created by others.

To learn more about how to create cakes, [Read the docs](https://docs.cakes.run), and go through the [examples repository](https://github.com/cake-cutter/examples)

## Your support is appreciated. Here‚Äôs how you can help

The entire stack - from the API, website, CLI, Docs - Everything is open source. You can find them on the [Cake-cutter github organisation.](https://github.com/cake-cutter)

‚≠ê Star all repositories to spread the word. Especially this one, the main CLI üëáüèª https://github.com/cake-cutter/cc
