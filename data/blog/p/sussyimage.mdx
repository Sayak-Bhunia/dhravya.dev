## What is it

SussyImage is a joke project because, you guessed it, I was bored. Inspired by reddit's r/place, I thought it would be cool if I could make a project that could use small images to imitate an image. I already had a little bit knowledge of OpenCV2, so making the actual thing wasn't the challenge: Making it somewhat efficient was.

The image don't have to be AmongUs characters, but for me (and well, the entire internet), Amongus is extremely funny, so I have included an amongus character pack in the repository, which is set to the default image directory.

Here's the github repository, it's a very simple project If you liked it EVEN ONE BIT, please star it lol ‚≠ê‚≠ê
